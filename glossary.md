# Glossary of Terms — Navigate Companion Framework™

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Navigate Companion Framework™ documentation, methodology, and interface design.

---

### 🧠 Emotional Fallback Strategy
A structured response mechanism used when a prompt expresses distress, confusion, or hopelessness. Rather than redirecting or fixing, the fallback response anchors the user emotionally — providing validation, grounding, or acknowledgment.

---

### 🎭 Tone Calibration
The process of adjusting the AI’s linguistic tone based on the user’s emotional state, topic, or previous inputs. This includes warmth, urgency, calm, and attunement levels — critical for trust and psychological safety.

---

### 🪨 Therapeutic Prompt Scaffolding
The layering of prompts or responses in a way that mirrors therapeutic progression — moving from validation → reflection → redirection → action, depending on user readiness and tone cues.

---

### 💬 Companion vs. Assistant
A “companion” focuses on emotional presence, empathy, and support, while an “assistant” emphasizes productivity, information retrieval, or transactional tasks. Navigate tools are **companions**, not AI assistants.

---

### ⚠️ Escalation Avoidance Protocol
A system within the prompt-response logic that minimizes the chance of reinforcing distress, anxiety spirals, or suicidal ideation. Includes safeguards, empathy redirects, and non-judgmental fallback responses.

---

### 🌊 LLM Fatigue
Cognitive or emotional exhaustion triggered by unhelpful, generic, or emotionally misaligned LLM outputs. Navigate is designed to **counter LLM fatigue** through emotionally intelligent engagement.

---

### 🧩 Micro-Attunement
The subtle adjustment of response format, word choice, or pacing based on user history, expression, or inferred psychological state. Often involves paraphrasing and tonal mirroring.

---

### 🛡️ Safety by Design
The philosophy that emotional, psychological, and ethical safety should be built into AI tools from the start — not retrofitted later. This includes tone filtering, prompt throttling, and non-pathologizing language rules.

---

### 🧭 Values-Based Reframing
A supportive redirection strategy borrowed from Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), where users are gently reminded of their personal values to move through difficult emotional states.
